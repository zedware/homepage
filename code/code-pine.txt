1. Install RPM packages and want not to use command line to send mails.

Download the RPMs from http://www.washington.edu/pine/getpine/linux.html.

$ su - root

# rpm -ivh pine-4.63-1.i386.rpm

or

# rpmbuild --rebuild pine-4.63-1.i386.src.rpm

2. Want to use command line to send mails?

Download the source code RPM from from http://www.washington.edu/pine/getpine/linux.html.
It is pine-4.63-1.i386.src.rpm.

Extract source code from RPM.

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir rpmfiles
$ cd rpmfiles
$ rpm2cpio $HOME/pine-4.63-1.src.rpm | cpio -iv --make-directories
$ tar -xzf pine4.63.tar.gz

$ pwd
/tmp/rpmfiles

$ gunzip outgoing.patch.gz

Apply the patch.
$ patch -p 0 < outgoing.patch

Build and install.
$ ./build slx

Executables are in pine4.63/bin.

Examples:
$ cat > hello.txt
hello
^D

$ ./pine4.63/bin/pine -I "^X,y" -subject "hello" guys@zedware.org < hello.txt
 
The last but important step is start pine and change the settings of smtp, etc.
