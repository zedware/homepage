
Solve the movie player problems on fc11.

1. Google to find a way to install codecs for totem, the default movie player.

rpm -ivh ...

Now, when I play a movie in rmvb, no sound at all.

2. Change the schedule mode for PulseAudio.

# sudo vi /etc/pulse/default.pa 

Change a line from: load-module module-hal-detect
                to: load-module module-hal-detect tsched=0

Restart the system, and I can here the sound. But the movie plays too fast.
I cannot hear it clearly.

3. 

Othere commands tried but with no good luck.

# modprobe snd_pcm_oss
