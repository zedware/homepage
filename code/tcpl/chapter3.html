<h1>Chapter 3 - Control Flow</h1>
<p><strong>The control-flow of a language specify the order in which computations are
  performed. We have already met the most common control-flow constructions in
  earlier examples; here we will complete the set, and be more precise about
  the ones discussed before.</strong></p>
<p><strong>程序的三种基本结构：顺序、分支、循环。</strong></p>
<p><strong>SQL是非过程化语言，PL/SQL（这是Oracle的叫法，SQL Server和Sybase的叫做T-SQL）、PL/Java等则是具备流程控制的过程化语言了。</strong></p>
<p><strong>实现DBMS与实现一般应用程序的区别：<br>
1. 处理的数据量很大，并且内存里一般放不下，I/O很多。<br>
2. 对用户提供的功能要很健壮，避免系统崩溃导致数据丢失或不准确。<br>
3. 
并发访问是需要考虑的基本问题，要熟悉进程/线程模型和各种IPC机制。</strong></p>
<h2><a name="s3.1">3.1 Statements and Blocks</a></h2>
An expression such as <tt>x = 0</tt> or <tt>i++</tt> or <tt>printf(...)</tt>
becomes a <em>statement</em> when it is followed by a semicolon, as in
<pre>
   x = 0;
   i++;
   printf(...);
</pre>
In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it
is in languages like Pascal.
<p>
Braces <tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt> are used to group declarations and statements
together into a <em>compound statement</em>, or <em>block</em>, so that they
are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround
the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple
statements after an <tt>if</tt>, <tt>else</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, or <tt>for</tt>
are another. <strong>(Variables can be declared inside <em>any</em> block; we will
talk about this in <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>.) There is no semicolon after the right brace that ends a block.</strong>
<h2><a name="s3.2">3.2 If-Else</a></h2>
The <tt>if-else</tt> statement is used to express decisions. Formally the syntax
is
<pre>
   if (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement<sub>1</sub></em>
   else
       <em>statement<sub>2</sub></em>
</pre>
where the <tt>else</tt> part is optional. The <em>expression</em> is evaluated;
if it is true (that is, if <em>expression</em> has a non-zero value),
<em>statement<sub>1</sub></em> is executed. If it is false (<em>expression</em>
is zero) and if there is an <tt>else</tt> part, <em>statement<sub>2</sub></em>
is executed instead.
<p>
Since an <tt>if</tt> tests the numeric value of an expression, certain coding
shortcuts are possible. The most obvious is writing
<pre>
   if (<em>expression</em>)
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
   if (<em>expression</em> != 0)
</pre>
<b>Sometimes this is natural and clear; at other times it can be cryptic(晦涩难懂的).</b>
<p>
Because the <tt>else</tt> part of an <tt>if-else</tt> is optional,there is an
ambiguity when an else if omitted from a nested <tt>if</tt> sequence. This is
resolved by associating the <tt>else</tt> with the closest previous
<tt>else</tt>-less <tt>if</tt>. For example, in
<pre>
   if (n &gt; 0)
       if (a &gt; b)
           z = a;
       else
           z = b;
</pre>
the <tt>else</tt> goes to the inner <tt>if</tt>, as we have shown by indentation.
If that isn't what you want, braces must be used to force the proper
association:
<pre>
   if (n &gt; 0) {
       if (a &gt; b)
            z = a;
   }
   else
       z = b;
</pre>
The ambiguity is especially<strong> pernicious(harmful，有害的)</strong> in situations like this:
<pre><strong>   if (n &gt; 0)
       for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
           if (s[i] &gt; 0) {
               printf("...");
               return i;
           }
   else        /* WRONG */
       printf("error -- n is negative\n");</strong></pre>
The indentation shows unequivocally what you want, but the compiler doesn't
get the message, and associates the <tt>else</tt> with the inner <tt>if</tt>.
This kind of bug can be hard to find; it's a good idea to use braces when
there are nested <tt>if</tt>s.
<p>
By the way, notice that there is a semicolon after <tt>z = a</tt> in
<pre>
   if (a &gt; b)
       z = a;
   else
       z = b;
</pre>
This is because grammatically, a <em>statement</em> follows the <tt>if</tt>,
and an expression statement like ``<tt>z = a;</tt>'' is always terminated by a
semicolon.

<h2><a name="s3.3">3.3 Else-If</a></h2>
The construction
<pre>
   if (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement</em>
   else if (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement</em>
   else if (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement</em>
   else if (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement</em>
   else
       <em>statement</em>
</pre>
occurs so often that it is worth a brief separate discussion. This sequence
of <tt>if</tt> statements is the most general way of writing a multi-way
decision. The <em>expressions</em> are evaluated in order; if an
<em>expression</em> is true, the <em>statement</em> associated with it is
executed, and this terminates the whole chain. As always, the code for each
<em>statement</em> is either a single statement, or a group of them in braces.
<p>
The last <tt>else</tt> part handles the ``none of the above'' or default case
where none of the other conditions is satisfied. Sometimes there is no
explicit action for the default; <strong>in that case the trailing</strong>
<pre>
   else
       <em>statement</em>
</pre>
<strong>can be omitted, or it may be used for error checking to catch an
``impossible'' condition.</strong>
<p>
To illustrate a three-way decision, here is a binary search function that
decides if a particular value <tt>x</tt> occurs in the sorted array <tt>v</tt>.
The elements of <tt>v</tt> must be in increasing order. The function returns the
position (a number between 0 and <tt>n-1</tt>) if <tt>x</tt> occurs in <tt>v</tt>,
and -1 if not.
<p class="STYLE1">
Binary search first compares the input value <tt>x</tt> to the middle element
of the array <tt>v</tt>. If <tt>x</tt> is less than the middle value, searching
focuses on the lower half of the table, otherwise on the upper half. In
either case, the next step is to compare <tt>x</tt> to the middle element of the
selected half. This process of dividing the range in two continues until the
value is found or the range is empty.
<pre><strong>   /* binsearch:  find x in v[0] &lt;= v[1] &lt;= ... &lt;= v[n-1] */
   int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)  <span class="STYLE18">/* 研究一下函数原型 */</span>
   {
       int low, high, mid;

       low = 0;
       high = n - 1;
       while (low &lt;= high) {
           mid = (low + high)/2;
           if (x &lt; v[mid])
               high = mid - 1;
           else if (x  &gt; v[mid])
               low = mid + 1;
           else    /* found match */
               return mid;
       }
       
       return -1;   /* no match */
   }</strong></pre>
<strong> The fundamental decision is whether <tt>x</tt> is less than, greater than, or
equal to the middle element <tt>v[mid]</tt> at each step; this is a natural
for <tt>else-if</tt>.</strong>
<p>
<strong>Exercise 3-1.</strong> Our binary search makes two tests inside the
loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside.) Write a
version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in
run-time.
<h2><a name="s3.4">3.4 Switch</a></h2>
The <tt>switch</tt> statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an
expression matches one of a number of <em>constant</em> integer values, and
branches accordingly.
<pre>
   switch (<em>expression</em>) {
       case <em>const-expr</em>: <em>statements</em>
       case <em>const-expr</em>: <em>statements</em>
       default: <em>statements</em>
   }
</pre>
<strong>Each case is labeled by one or more integer-valued constants or constant
expressions. If a case matches the expression value, execution starts at that
case. All case expressions must be different. The case labeled <tt>default</tt>
is executed if none of the other cases are satisfied. A <tt>default</tt> is
optional; if it isn't there and if none of the cases match, no action at all
takes place. Cases and the default clause can occur in any order.</strong>
<p>
In <a href="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a> we wrote a program to count the occurrences
of each digit, white space, and all other characters, using a sequence of
<tt>if ... else if ... else</tt>. Here is the same program with a <tt>switch</tt>:
<pre>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   int main(void)  /* count digits, white space, others */
   {
       int c, i, nwhite, nother, ndigit[10];

       nwhite = nother = 0;
       for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
           ndigit[i] = 0;

       while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
           switch (c) {
           case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4':
           case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9':
               ndigit[c-'0']++;
               break;

           case ' ':
           case '\n':
           case '\t':
               nwhite++;
               break;

           <strong>default:</strong>
               nother++;
               <strong>break;</strong>
           }
       }

       printf("digits =");
       for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
           printf(" %d", ndigit[i]);
       printf(", white space = %d, other = %d\n",
           nwhite, nother);

       return 0;
   }
</pre>
<strong>The <tt>break</tt> statement causes an immediate exit from the <tt>switch</tt>.
Because cases serve just as labels, after the code for one case is done,
execution <em>falls through</em> to the next unless you take explicit action to
escape. <tt>break</tt> and <tt>return</tt> are the most common ways to leave a
<tt>switch</tt>. A <tt>break</tt> statement can also be used to force an immediate
exit from <tt>while</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, and <tt>do</tt> loops, as will be
discussed later in this chapter.</strong>
<p>
Falling through cases is a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it allows
several cases to be attached to a single action, as with the digits in this
example. But it also implies that normally each case must end with a <tt>break</tt>
to prevent falling through to the next. Falling through from one case
to another is not robust, being prone to disintegration when the program is
modified. With the exception of multiple labels for a single computation,
<b>fall-throughs should be used sparingly, and commented</b>.
<p><strong>
As a matter of good form, put a <tt>break</tt> after the last case (the
<tt>default</tt> here) even though it's logically unnecessary. Some day when
another case gets added at the end, this bit of defensive programming will
save you.
</strong>
<p>
<strong>Exercise 3-2.</strong> Write a function <tt>escape(s,t)</tt> that
converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like
<tt>\n</tt> and <tt>\t</tt> as it copies the string <tt>t</tt> to <tt>s</tt>.
Use a <tt>switch</tt>. Write a function for the other direction as well,
converting escape sequences into the real characters.
<h2><a name="s3.5">3.5 Loops - While and For</a></h2>
We have already encountered the <tt>while</tt> and <tt>for</tt> loops. In
<pre>
   while (<em>expression</em>)
       <em>statement</em>
</pre>
the <em>expression</em> is evaluated. If it is non-zero, <em>statement</em>
is executed and <em>expression</em> is re-evaluated. This cycle continues
until <em>expression</em> becomes zero, at which point execution resumes
after <em>statement</em>.
<p>
The <tt>for</tt> statement
<pre>
   for (<em>expr<sub>1</sub></em>; <em>expr<sub>2</sub></em>; <em>expr<sub>3</sub></em>)
       <em>statement</em>
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
   <em>expr<sub>1</sub></em>;
   while (<em>expr<sub>2</sub></em>) {
       <em>statement</em>
       <em>expr<sub>3</sub></em>;
   }
</pre>
except for the behaviour of <tt>continue</tt>, which is described in
<a href="#s3.7">Section 3.7</a>.
<p>
Grammatically, the three components of a <tt>for</tt> loop are expressions. Most
commonly, <em>expr<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>expr<sub>3</sub></em> are assignments or function
calls and <em>expr<sub>2</sub></em> is a relational expression. Any of the three parts
can be omitted, although the semicolons must remain. If <em>expr<sub>1</sub></em> or
<em>expr<sub>3</sub></em> is omitted, it is simply dropped from the expansion. If the
test, <em>expr<sub>2</sub></em>, is not present, it is taken as permanently true, so
<pre><strong>   for (;;) 
   {
       ...
   }</strong></pre>
<strong>is an ``infinite'' loop, presumably to be broken by other means, such as a
<tt>break</tt> or <tt>return</tt>.</strong>
<p>
Whether to use <tt>while</tt> or <tt>for</tt> is largely a matter of personal
preference. For example, in
<pre>
   while ((c = getchar()) == ' ' || c == '\n' || c = '\t')
       ;   /* skip white space characters */
</pre>
there is no initialization or re-initialization, so the <tt>while</tt> is most
natural.
<p>
The <tt>for</tt> is preferable when there is a simple initialization and
increment since it keeps the loop control statements close together and
visible at the top of the loop. This is most obvious in
<pre>
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
       ...
</pre>
which is the C idiom for processing the first <tt>n</tt> elements of an array,
the analog of the Fortran DO loop or the Pascal <tt>for</tt>. The analogy is not
perfect, however, since the index variable <tt>i</tt> retains its value when the
loop terminates for any reason. Because the components of the <tt>for</tt> are
arbitrary expressions, <tt>for</tt> loops are not restricted to arithmetic
progressions. Nonetheless, it is bad style to force unrelated computations
into the initialization and increment of a <tt>for</tt>, which are better
reserved for loop control operations.
<p><strong>
As a larger example, here is another version of <tt>atoi</tt> for converting a
string to its numeric equivalent. This one is slightly more general than the
one in <a href="chapter3.html">Chapter 2</a>; it copes with optional leading white space
and an optional <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> sign. (<a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>
shows <tt>atof</tt>, which does the same conversion for floating-point numbers.)
</strong>
<p>
The structure of the program reflects the form of the input:
<p>
<em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skip white space, if any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;get sign, if any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;get integer part and convert it</em>
<p>
Each step does its part, and leaves things in a clean state for the next. The
whole process terminates on the first character that could not be part of a
number.
<pre><strong>   #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

   /* atoi:  convert s to integer; version 2 */
   int atoi(char s[])  <span class="STYLE18">/* 研究一下函数原型 */</span>
   {
       int i, n, sign;

       for (i = 0; isspace(s[i]); i++)  /* skip white space */
           ;
       sign = (s[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
       if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '-')  /* skip sign */
           i++;
       for (n = 0; isdigit(s[i]); i++)
           n = 10 * n + (s[i] - '0');
       return sign * n;
   }</strong></pre>
The standard library provides a more elaborate function <strong><tt>strtol</tt></strong>
for conversion of strings to long integers; see
<a href="appb.html#sb.5">Section 5 of Appendix B</a>.
<p>
The advantages of keeping loop control centralized are even more obvious when
there are several nested loops. The following function is a Shell sort for
sorting an array of integers. The basic idea of this sorting algorithm, which
was invented in 1959 by D. L. Shell, is that in early stages, far-apart
elements are compared, rather than adjacent ones as in simpler interchange
sorts. This tends to eliminate large amounts of disorder quickly, so later
stages have less work to do. The interval between compared elements is
gradually decreased to one, at which point the sort effectively becomes an
adjacent interchange method.
<pre><strong>   /* shellsort:  sort v[0]...v[n-1] into increasing order */
   void shellsort(int v[], int n)
   {
       int gap, i, j, temp;

       for (gap = n/2; gap &gt; 0; gap /= 2)
           for (i = gap; i &lt; n; i++)
               for (j = i - gap; j >= 0 && v[j] > v[j + gap]; j -= gap) {
                   temp = v[j];
                   v[j] = v[j + gap];
                   v[j + gap] = temp;
               }
   }</strong></pre>
There are three nested loops. The outermost controls the gap between
compared elements, shrinking it from <tt>n/2</tt> by a factor of two each
pass until it becomes zero. The middle loop steps along the elements. The
innermost loop compares each pair of elements that is separated by <tt>gap</tt>
and reverses any that are out of order. Since <tt>gap</tt> is eventually reduced
to one, all elements are eventually ordered correctly. Notice how the
generality of the <tt>for</tt> makes the outer loop fit in the same form as the
others, even though it is not an arithmetic progression.
<p>
<strong>One final C operator is the comma ``<tt>,</tt>'', which most often finds use in
the <tt>for</tt> statement. A pair of expressions separated by a comma is
evaluated left to right, and the type and value of the result are the type
and value of the right operand. </strong>Thus in a for statement, it is possible to
place multiple expressions in the various parts, for example to process two
indices in parallel. This is illustrated in the function <tt>reverse(s)</tt>,
which reverses the string <tt>s</tt> in place.
<pre><strong>
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   /* reverse:  reverse string s in place */
   void reverse(char s[]) <span class="STYLE18">/* 研究一下函数原型 */</span>
   {
       int c, i, j;

       for (i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i &lt; j; i++, j--) 
       {
           c = s[i];
           s[i] = s[j];
           s[j] = c;
       }
   }</strong></pre>
The commas that separate function arguments, variables in declarations, etc.,
are <em>not</em> comma operators, and do not guarantee left to right evaluation.
<p>
Comma operators should be used sparingly. The most suitable uses are for
constructs strongly related to each other, as in the <tt>for</tt> loop in
<tt>reverse</tt>, and in macros where a multistep computation has to be a single
expression. A comma expression might also be appropriate for the exchange of
elements in <tt>reverse</tt>, where the exchange can be thought of a single
operation:
<pre>
    for (i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i &lt; j; i++, j--)
        c = s[i], s[i] = s[j], s[j] = c;
</pre>
<strong>*Exercise 3-3.</strong> Write a function <tt>expand(s1,s2)</tt> that expands
shorthand notations like <tt>a-z</tt> in the string <tt>s1</tt> into the equivalent
complete list <tt>abc...xyz</tt> in <tt>s2</tt>. Allow for letters of either case
and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like <tt>a-b-c</tt> and <tt>a-z0-9</tt>
and <tt>-a-z</tt>. Arrange that a leading or trailing <tt>-</tt> is taken
literally.

<h2><a name="s3.6">3.6 Loops - Do-While</a></h2>
As we discussed in <a href="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a>, the <tt>while</tt>
and <tt>for</tt> loops test the termination condition at the top. By contrast,
the third loop in C, the <tt>do-while</tt>, tests at the bottom <em>after</em>
making each pass through the loop body; the body is always executed at least
once.
<p>
The syntax of the <tt>do</tt> is
<pre>
   do
       <em>statement</em>
   while (<em>expression</em>);
</pre>
The <em>statement</em> is executed, then <em>expression</em> is evaluated. If
it is true, <em>statement</em> is evaluated again, and so on. When the expression
becomes false, the loop terminates. Except for the sense of the test,
<tt>do-while</tt> is equivalent to the Pascal <tt>repeat-until</tt> statement.
<p class="STYLE2">
Experience shows that <tt>do-while</tt> is much less used than <tt>while</tt> and
<tt>for</tt>. Nonetheless, from time to time it is valuable, as in the following
function <tt>itoa</tt>, which converts a number to a character string (the inverse
of <tt>atoi</tt>). The job is slightly more complicated than might be thought at
first, because the easy methods of generating the digits generate them in the
wrong order. We have chosen to generate the string backwards, then reverse it.
<pre><strong>   /* itoa:  convert n to characters in s */
   void itoa(int n, char s[])  <span class="STYLE18">/* 研究一下函数原型 */</span>
   {
       int i, sign;

       if ((sign = n) &lt; 0)  /* record sign */
           n = -n;          /* make n positive */

       i = 0;
       do 
       {
           /* generate digits in reverse order */
           s[i++] = n % 10 + '0';  /* get next digit */
       } while ((n /= 10) &gt; 0);    /* delete it */

       if (sign &lt; 0)
           s[i++] = '-';
       s[i] = '\0';

       reverse(s);
   }</strong></pre>
The <tt>do-while</tt> is necessary, or at least convenient, since at least one
character must be installed in the array <tt>s</tt>, even if <tt>n</tt> is zero.
We also used braces around the single statement that makes up the body of the
<tt>do-while</tt>, even though they are unnecessary, so the hasty reader will not
mistake the <tt>while</tt> part for the <em>beginning</em> of a <tt>while</tt> loop.
<p>
<strong>*Exercise 3-4.</strong> <span class="STYLE3">In a two's complement number representation, our version
of <tt>itoa</tt> does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value
of <tt>n</tt> equal to -(2<sup>wordsize-1</sup>). Explain why not. Modify it to
print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs.</span>
<p>
<strong>*Exercise 3-5.</strong> Write the function <tt>itob(n,s,b)</tt> that converts the
integer <tt>n</tt> into a base <tt>b</tt> character representation in the string
<tt>s</tt>. In particular, <tt>itob(n,s,16)</tt> formats <tt>s</tt> as a hexadecimal
integer in <tt>s</tt>.
<p>
<strong>Exercise 3-6.</strong> Write a version of <tt>itoa</tt> that accepts
three arguments instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width;
the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to
make it wide enough.
<h2><a name="s3.7">3.7 Break and Continue</a></h2>
It is sometimes convenient to be able to exit from a loop other than by
testing at the top or bottom. The <tt>break</tt> statement provides an early
exit from <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, and <tt>do</tt>, just as from <tt>switch</tt>.
A <tt>break</tt> causes the innermost enclosing loop or <tt>switch</tt> to be
exited immediately.
<p class="STYLE4">
The following function, <tt>trim</tt>, removes trailing blanks, tabs and
newlines from the end of a string, using a <tt>break</tt> to exit from a loop
when the rightmost non-blank, non-tab, non-newline is found.
<pre><strong>   /* trim:  remove trailing blanks, tabs, newlines */
   int trim(char s[])
   {
       int n;

       assert(s != NULL);

       for (n = strlen(s) - 1; n &gt;= 0; n--)
       {
           if (s[n] != ' ' && s[n] != '\t' && s[n] != '\n')
               break;
       }
               
       s[n + 1] = '\0';
       return n;
   }</strong></pre>
<tt>strlen</tt> returns the length of the string. The <tt>for</tt> loop starts at the
end and scans backwards looking for the first character that is not a blank or
tab or newline. The loop is broken when one is found, or when <tt>n</tt> becomes
negative (that is, when the entire string has been scanned). You should verify
that this is correct behavior even when the string is empty or contains only
white space characters.
<p>
The <tt>continue</tt> statement is related to <tt>break</tt>, but less often used;
it causes the next iteration of the enclosing <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, or
<tt>do</tt> loop to begin. In the <tt>while</tt> and <tt>do</tt>, this means that the test
part is executed immediately; in the <tt>for</tt>, control passes to the increment
step. The <tt>continue</tt> statement applies only to loops, not to <tt>switch</tt>.
A <tt>continue</tt> inside a <tt>switch</tt> inside a loop causes the next loop
iteration.
<p>
As an example, this fragment processes only the non-negative elements in the
array <tt>a</tt>; negative values are skipped.
<pre>
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
   {
       if (a[i] &lt; 0)   /* skip negative elements */
           continue;
       ... /* do positive elements */
   }    
</pre>
The <tt>continue</tt> statement is often used when the part of the loop that
follows is complicated, so that reversing a test and indenting another level
would nest the program too deeply.

<h2><a name="s3.8">3.8 Goto and labels</a></h2>
C provides the infinitely-abusable <tt>goto</tt> statement, and labels to branch
to. Formally, the <tt>goto</tt> statement is never necessary, and in practice it
is almost always easy to write code without it. We have not used <tt>goto</tt>
in this book.
<p><strong>
Nevertheless, there are a few situations where <tt>goto</tt>s may find a place.
The most common is to abandon processing in some deeply nested structure, such
as breaking out of two or more loops at once. The <tt>break</tt> statement cannot
be used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop. Thus:
</strong>
<pre><strong>       for ( ... ) {
           for ( ... ) {
               ...
               if (disaster)
                   goto error;
           }
           ...
       }
       
   error:
       /* clean up the mess */
</strong></pre>
This organization is handy if the error-handling code is non-trivial, and if
errors can occur in several places.
<p>
A label has the same form as a variable name, and is followed by a colon. It
can be attached to any statement in the same function as the <tt>goto</tt>.
The scope of a label is the entire function.
<p>
As another example, consider the problem of determining whether two arrays
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> have an element in common. One possibility is
<pre>
       for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
           for (j = 0; j &lt; m; j++) {
               if (a[i] == b[j])
                   <strong>goto found;</strong>
           }
       }
       
       /* didn't find any common element */
       ...
   <strong>found:</strong>
       /* got one: a[i] == b[j] */
       ...
</pre>
Code involving a <tt>goto</tt> can always be written without one, though perhaps
at the price of some repeated tests or an extra variable. For example, the
array search becomes
<pre>
   found = 0;
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n && !found; i++) {
       for (j = 0; j &lt; m && !found; j++) {
           if (a[i] == b[j])
               found = 1;
       }
   }
           
   if (found)
       /* got one: a[i-1] == b[j-1] */
       ...
   else
       /* didn't find any common element */
       ...
</pre>
<strong>With a few exceptions like those cited here, code that relies on <tt>goto</tt>
statements is generally harder to understand and to maintain than code without
<tt>goto</tt>s. Although we are not dogmatic about the matter, it does seem that
<tt>goto</tt> statements should be used rarely, if at all.</strong>

<p class="STYLE5">
Summary of the usage of goto statement(zedware):
<p><strong> 1. to jump out nested loops quickly.
</strong>
<pre><strong>
    for ( ; ; )
    {
        for ( ; ; )
        {
            for ( ; ; )
            {
                if (expr)
                    goto found;
            }
        }
    }
    
found:
</strong></pre>
                
<strong>2. to implement state machine or some retry cases.</strong>
<pre><strong>
retry1:
    ...
retry2:
        
        ...
        goto retry1;
        ...
        goto retry2;
</strong></pre>
    
<strong>3. to simplify the code of resource management.

First method: use nested if.</strong>
<ul class="STYLE11">
<li>
doesnot look well. If there are more than 3 if(s), the source code will 
shift to right of the screen.</li>   
<li>
hard to maintain. It is hard to change the order of the resource allocation
calls, to insert new ones in some cases. And it may be hard to understand.</li>
</ul>

<pre><strong>
int foo(void)
{
    char *p, *q;
    FILE *fp;
    ...

    p = (char *) malloc(len);
    if (p != NULL)
    {
        q = (char *) malloc(len);
        if (q != NULL)
        {
            fp = fopen(file_name, "a");
            if (fp != NULL)
            {
                ...
            
                fclose(fp);
                return 0;
            }
            
            free(q);    
        }
        
        free(p);
    }
    
    return -1;
}
</strong></pre>

<strong>Second method: use if and return.</strong>
<ul class="STYLE14">
<li>
duplicated code.</li>  
<li>
hard to maintain. Hard to add resource allocation calls.</li>
</ul>

<pre><strong>
int foo(void)
{
    char *p, *q;
    FILE *fp;
    ...

    p = (char *) malloc(len);
    if (p == NULL)
        return -1;

    q = (char *) malloc(len);
    if (q == NULL)
    {
        free(p);
        return -1;
    }
    
    fp = fopen(file_name, "a");
    if (fp == NULL)
    {
        free(p);
        free(q);
        return -1;
    }
    
    ...
    
    free(p);
    free(q);
    fclose(fp);
    
    return 0;
}
</strong></pre>

<strong>Third method: use goto.</strong>
<ul class="STYLE17">
<li>
consistent style.</li>
<li>
good maintainance.</li>
<li> 
must initialize variables to invalid values first.</li>
</ul>

<pre><strong>
int foo(void)
{
    int rc = -1;
    char *p = NULL, *q = NULL;
    FILE *fp = NULL;
    ...
    
    p = (char *) malloc(len);
    if (p == NULL)
        goto error_exit;

    q = (char *) malloc(len)
    if (q == NULL)
        goto error_exit;
        
    fp = fopen(file_name, "a");
    if (fp == NULL)
        goto error_exit;
        
    ...
    
    /* everything is ok. */
    rc = 0;
    
error_exit:<br>
    if (p != NULL)
        free(p);
    if (q != NULL)
        free(q);
    if (fp != NULL)
        fclose(fp);
