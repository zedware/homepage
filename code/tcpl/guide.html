<h1>A Guide to the Students</h1>
<p>
In the good old days, we learned programming on the old machines, 
like VAX, IBM PC, Workstation, Mac, etc. On DOS/Windows, the classical 
IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) are Turbo C/C++ and Borland C/C++, then 
Microsoft Visual Studio, followed by Eclipse. Nowadays, writing programs 
heavily depended on a modern IDE. Among them, Visual Studio Code
(vscode) from Microsoft, CLion from JetBrains, Xcode from Apple are the 
most popular ones.  Traditionnal editors like Vim and Emacs are still widely 
used. Powered by modern plugins, they can also be configured as powerful as
the modern IDEs. For beginners, I would suggest using the IDE. But if you
are comfortable with Linux, using Vim or Emacs is ok.
<p>
All of the IDEs or editors must run on an Operating System. We can choose 
among the different distributions of Linux, macOS, and Windows. If we prefer 
Windows, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (esp. version 2, WSL2) is a good choice 
if you prefer a Linux environment. As in the era of Cloud Computing, 
we can use our laptops or the virtual machines provided by the Cloud vendors 
like Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, etc.
<p>
Installing the operating system, the IDEs or editors, or compilers are out of the 
scope of the book. Please refer to the resources on the Internet, or ask the 
teaching assistants if you are enrolled in a university course.
<p>
Lastly, being familiar with the tools is critical for a programmer. But the materials
are ignored in most courses provided by the universities all over the world.
<a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu">The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</a>
from MIT is probably the best one to fix it. It will teach you how to master the 
command-line, text editor, the Git version control systems, security, and cryptography.
<p>
Little changes are made to the text. Some of the text are changed to bold text, while 
some comments are inserted in Chinese. And the sample code has some minor changes to
make it more like real programs, for example, "main()" is changed to "int main(void)".
