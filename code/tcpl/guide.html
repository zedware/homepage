    <h1>A Guide to the Students</h1>
    <p>
        In the good old days, we learned programming on the old machines,
        like VAX, IBM PC, Sun Workstation, Mac, etc. On DOS and Windows, the classical
        IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) are Turbo C/C++ and Borland C/C++, then
        Microsoft Visual Studio, followed by Eclipse. Nowadays, writing programs
        heavily depended on a modern IDE. Among them, Visual Studio Code
        (vscode) from Microsoft, CLion from JetBrains, Xcode from Apple are the
        most popular ones. Traditionnal editors like Vim and Emacs are still widely
        used. Powered by modern plugins, they can also be configured as powerful as
        the modern IDEs. For beginners, I would suggest using the IDEs. But if you
        are comfortable with Linux, using Vim or Emacs is also ok.
    <p>
        All of the IDEs or editors must run on an Operating System. We can choose
        among the different distributions of Linux, macOS, and Windows. If we use a
        Windows laptop, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (esp. the version 2, WSL2) is
        a good choice if you prefer a Linux environment. As in the era of Cloud Computing,
        we can also the virtual machines provided by the Cloud vendors like Amazon Web Service,
        Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, etc. The big three Cloud Providers in China are
        Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun), Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.
    <p>
        Installing the operating system, the IDEs or editors, or compilers are out of the
        scope of the book. Please refer to the resources on the Internet, or ask the
        teaching assistants if you are enrolled in a university course. Possible combinations are:
    <ul>
        <li>Ubuntu + Visual Studio Code + gcc/gdb (clang/lldb)</li>
        <li>macOS + Visual Studio Code + clang/lldb</li>
        <li>Windows (WSL2 with Ubuntu) + Visual Studio Code + gcc/gdb (clang/lldb)</li>
        <li>Windows + Visual Studio (with the compiler and tools, MSVC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some universities in China recommend students to use Windows + Visual Studio Code + MinGW.
        I think it is not a good idea, since MinGW is not used widely in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, being familiar with the tools is critical for a programmer. But the materials
        are ignored in most courses provided by the universities all over the world.
        <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu">The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</a>
        from MIT is probably the best one to fix it. It will teach you how to master the
        command-line tools, text editors, the Git version control system, security, and cryptography.
    <p>
        Little changes are made to the text of the original K&R C book. Some of the text are
        changed to bold text, while some comments are inserted in Chinese. And the sample code
        has some minor changes to make it more like real programs nowadays, for example, "main()" is changed
        to "int main(void)", and always has a return statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is hard to write programs correctly without any bugs. And most beginners may tend to
        use a debugger like `gdb' or `lldb' to debug. Some may use the interactive interface in
        IDEs. I would prefer the basic output statements like `printf', and the `assert' statement.
        Knowing each line we write can help build good habits and write bugless code. A debugger
        is more helpful to analyse the coredump.
